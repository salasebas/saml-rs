# Web Browser SSO acceptance rules

Inbound rules for typed Web Browser SSO: service-provider `finish_sso` and
`accept_unsolicited_sso`, and identity-provider `receive_sso`.
`SpValidationPolicy::recommended` includes the service-provider rows below. It
also includes the Single Logout accept combination and leaves AuthnRequest
signing and identifier creation off. Those last three are not part of this
accept combination; they are recorded with logout and generation.
`IdpValidationPolicy::recommended` includes the identity-provider rows below
and the same logout accept combination. `Default`, `new`, `try_new`, and
the config builders are Recommended. Recommended does not select the
RSA-SHA2 XML-DSig profile. `compatibility()` is available by name. The
preset distinction is recorded in
[validation presets](../adr/0002-validation-presets.md).

Normative text is SAML Core 2.0, Profiles 2.0, and Bindings 2.0, as corrected
by Approved Errata 05. HTTP-POST-SimpleSign is the supported CD04 binding.
Schema citations are the OASIS assertion and protocol schemas.

Outbound AuthnRequest signing, identifier creation, and logout are not part of
the service-provider accept combination. Single Logout acceptance is classified
in [single-logout.md](single-logout.md). Replay and metadata trust stay caller
arguments, classified in [metadata-and-replay.md](metadata-and-replay.md).

## Service provider

`finish_sso` and `accept_unsolicited_sso` read `SpValidationPolicy`. Callers
select the accept combination by setting the fields below.

| Rule | Actor | Direction | Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Do not require a signature directly on the Assertion | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Library hardening, off. `AssertionSignaturePolicy::AllowUnsignedForCompatibility`. `RequireSigned` is the hardening |
| Require a Response signature when an `EncryptedAssertion` uses CBC | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Recommendation, on. `ResponseSignaturePolicy::RequireForEncryptedCbc`. Relax it with `AllowUnsignedEncryptedCbc`. `RequireSigned` on every response is separate library hardening |
| Do not require the RSA-SHA2 XML signature profile | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Library hardening, off. `XmlSignatureProfile::AllowProviderSupportedForCompatibility`. Conformance §4.1 requires RSAwithSHA1, and Core §5.4.4 does not require a verifier to reject other transforms |
| Evaluate an `<AudienceRestriction>` that is present | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory when the element is present. `AudienceValidationPolicy::EvaluatePresentRestrictions`. `Validate` also rejects a missing restriction. That extra rejection is library hardening. Recommended uses `EvaluatePresentRestrictions` |
| Several `<AudienceRestriction>` elements are all required, and audiences inside one restriction are alternatives | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory when the elements are present. Core §2.5.1.4, Approved Errata 05 E46. No off switch beyond the audience policy above |
| Reject a `<Conditions>` child that is not understood | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Core §2.5.1.1. Indeterminate is rejected. No off switch |
| `<OneTimeUse>` does not affect validity and the assertion is not retained | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory when the element is present. Core §2.5.1.5. Always Valid. The typed session is not kept for a later exchange |
| `<ProxyRestriction>` does not affect validity | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory when the element is present. Core §2.5.1.6. Always Valid. This service provider does not issue a later assertion |
| Evaluate every assertion, which must share one issuer and one principal | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Approved Errata 05 E26, Profiles §§4.1.4.2 and 4.1.4.3. One successful bearer confirmation confirms that assertion. The principal is `NameID` value, `Format`, `NameQualifier`, and `SPNameQualifier`. An omitted `Format` is `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified` (Core §2.2.2). Replay storage keeps every direct assertion identifier until that assertion's bearer `NotOnOrAfter` |
| An unsigned sibling assertion is not a second signed assertion | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Errata 05 E26, Profiles §4.1.4.5. Several assertions are accepted only when the response is signed or every assertion is directly signed |
| UTC `IssueInstant` on the Response and the Assertion | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. No off switch. Core §1.3.3 forbids a producer from generating a leap second and does not require the receiver to reject one |
| HTTP POST protects each assertion with a signature on the Assertion or the Response | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Errata 05 E26, Profiles §4.1.4.5 |
| Bearer `Recipient`, `NotOnOrAfter`, and `InResponseTo` | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Errata 05 E26, Profiles §4.1.4.3. An unsolicited response must not carry `InResponseTo` |
| Allow five minutes of clock skew on `NotBefore` and `NotOnOrAfter` | Relying party | Inbound | Recommendation. Approved Errata 05 E92 adds Core §1.3.3 guidance to `Conditions` and to `SubjectConfirmationData`. A new `SamlValidationContext` uses five minutes, the top of the three-to-five-minute range. `NotBefore` is accepted that early. `NotOnOrAfter` stays exclusive after that allowance. The same `NotOnOrAfter` drift also widens `AuthnStatement@SessionNotOnOrAfter`. That session check is existing library policy, not an E92 insertion for the attribute. `ClockSkew::strict` is zero. An explicit skew replaces the five minutes. This is not a validation-preset field |
| Apply a caller-supplied outstanding logout to a later assertion for the same principal and session | Accepting service provider | Inbound `finish_sso_with_outstanding_logout` and `accept_unsolicited_sso_with_outstanding_logout` | Mandatory when the caller supplies the logout. Core §3.7.3.1. Typed NameID values must be equal, and a `Format` on the logout must match (Core §3.3.4). An omitted `Format` compares values only. A received `LogoutRequest` `NameID` keeps `Format` when the request includes it. `NameQualifier`, `SPNameQualifier`, and `SPProvidedID` are not compared. No `SessionIndex` applies to every session of that principal. The context `NotOnOrAfter` skew applies. At or after that deadline the logout does not reject. `finish_sso` and `accept_unsolicited_sso` omit the check. No session store |
| A present `Destination` identifies the actual recipient | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Core §3.2.2. A signed HTTP-Redirect or HTTP-POST message carries `Destination`, and the recipient verifies it |
| Check the bearer `Address` | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Optional. Stays off. Profiles §4.1.4.3 |
| `RelayState` does not exceed 80 bytes | Accepting service provider | Inbound `finish_sso` and `accept_unsolicited_sso` | Mandatory prohibition. Bindings §3.5.3 and HTTP-POST-SimpleSign CD-04 §2.3 |
| HTTP-POST-SimpleSign verifies the raw XML octets, then `RelayState` when present, then `SigAlg` | Accepting service provider | Inbound | Mandatory when that binding is used. CD-04 §2.6. An absent `RelayState` is omitted |

## Identity provider

`receive_sso` reads `IdpValidationPolicy.authn_requests`. The accept combination
is `AuthnRequestValidationPolicy::AllowUnsignedVerifyIfPresent`.

| Rule | Actor | Direction | Level |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Require a signed `AuthnRequest` | Identity provider | Inbound | Optional. Stays off unless `RequireSigned` |
| Verify a signature that is present | Identity provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Core §3.2.1. `AllowUnsignedForCompatibility` is the samlify-port hatch and does not verify it |
| UTC `IssueInstant` | Identity provider | Inbound | Mandatory. No off switch. An inbound leap-second value stays accepted |
| Limit an `AuthnRequest` `IssueInstant` to a caller-chosen maximum age | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Library hardening, off. Core §1.3.3 requires a UTC `IssueInstant` and does not define a maximum age. Enabling it can reject a conformant request. `AuthnRequestAgePolicy::Disabled` is the default on `SamlValidationContext::new`. `Bounded { max_age }` accepts an instant at or after `now - max_age - past_tolerance` and at or before `now + future_tolerance`, both edges inclusive. Past tolerance is the `NotOnOrAfter` skew when that skew is positive, otherwise zero. Future tolerance is the magnitude of the `NotBefore` skew when that skew is negative, otherwise zero. `ClockSkew::five_minutes` widens only a `Bounded` window. An inverted skew does not shrink `max_age`. `max_age` of zero leaves that skew neighborhood. The check runs after signature and `Destination` handling and before replay storage. It is not a field of `IdpValidationPolicy` and it is not part of `recommended()` or Compatibility |
| A present `Destination` matches a published `SingleSignOnService` `Location` or `ResponseLocation` for the request binding | Identity provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Core §3.2.1. Metadata §2.2.2 allows more than one endpoint for a binding. Each published location is this recipient |
| `AssertionConsumerServiceURL` or `AssertionConsumerServiceIndex` belongs to the service provider | Identity provider | Inbound | Mandatory. Profiles §4.1.4.1. The check runs when the response is issued |
| Expose `ForceAuthn` when present; leave it absent when omitted | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Optional. Core §3.4.1. Omission stays absent. Presence does not reject the request |
| Expose `IsPassive` when present; leave it absent when omitted | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Optional. Core §3.4.1. Omission stays absent. Presence does not reject the request |
| `ForceAuthn` and `IsPassive` are unqualified booleans | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Mandatory. Schema `AuthnRequestType`. Values are `true`, `false`, `1`, and `0`. A qualified attribute is rejected |
| Expose a requested `Subject` when present; leave it absent when omitted | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Optional. Core §3.4.1 and §3.4.1.4 / E75. A valid subject does not reject the request |
| No identifier in that `Subject` means the presenter is the requested subject | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Core §3.4.1. `<BaseID>` and `<EncryptedID>` stay distinct and are not decoded |
| Requested `<NameID>` keeps its content and qualifier attributes | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Core §3.3.4. A qualified `NameQualifier`, `SPNameQualifier`, or `SPProvidedID` is rejected |
| One `Subject` and one identifier element | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | A second `Subject`, a second identifier, or a foreign namespace is rejected |
| `RelayState` does not exceed 80 bytes | Identity provider | Inbound `receive_sso` | Mandatory prohibition. Bindings §3.4.3, §3.5.3, and HTTP-POST-SimpleSign CD-04 §2.3 |
| HTTP-Redirect verifies `SAMLRequest`, `RelayState` when present, then `SigAlg`, using the original URL-encoded values | Identity provider | Inbound AuthnRequest | Mandatory when the request is signed with that binding. Bindings §3.4.4.1. The message is raw-inflated after base64 decoding |
| HTTP-POST-SimpleSign verifies the raw XML octets, then `RelayState` when present, then `SigAlg` | Identity provider | Inbound AuthnRequest | Mandatory when that binding is used. CD-04 §2.6 |
